We can consume enemies we would normally swallow and spit them out as vegetables! We don't mean to boast, rather we hope to teach and encourage proper eating habits, just as I currently am with my daughter right now! Where we come from, we grow our vegetables to become superfood through only the most sustainable of methods, with the ability to purge all evil in addition to their daily nutritional value. If you ever feel you need a lifestyle change, travel to our humble home: Mole Mountain! I hope you'll consider it!"

Our chilling climate, while quite beautiful, can get quite dreary and chilling once you adjust yourself to it. It's not all bad, though! I often take my son out for some ice curling. We absolutely love consuming enemies other Yoshis would normally swallow & spitting them out as ice blocks. They slide so well and make for an amazing time! Visit us in the Freezing Frostlands if you'd like to try it out sometime! We'll welcome you with warm, open arms!"

"Hey, hey! It's my most favourite trio of challengers! I honestly had no idea that you were all so close to my uncle Toadsworth. That's so cool! I tell you, he has an enriched history. We are as close as can be when it comes to family. We've even worked together to come up with innovative new ways to protect our kingdom against all evil. I'm sure he told you that I'm a certified engineer, hence the vast array of ships, challenges, & homes in the snow & sky worlds! Impressive, huh? I'm glad you think so! This is my life's passion & I'm thankful to our creator for gifting me each day! Now, with me at the helm, we're going to have a great time! YEEHAW!"

"My, my! The view from up here is splendid & so relaxing! I truly did need this. Although I don't like to mention it much, I get exposed to some truly traumatizing things locked away at the clutches of Bowser. This is true especially now since he has discovered the truth about my family bloodline. Now that this secret's been revealed, it's time that I finally explain to you what exactly has been instilled within us. So as Bowser mentioned, there does exist a legend that states we, the royal monarchs of the Mushroom Kingdom we born with a special 'gift' of sorts. Calling it a gift would be somewhat misleading though, as it's both a blessing & a curse."

I've had my fair share of adventure in my time the same as you, & could go on for absolute hours about what I've experienced! In short, I've been a veteran of the Mushroom Kingdom Royal Forces for 68 years & have been helping to defend the Kingdom over two generations, with you heroes next in line! I most proudly pass the torch onto you, wishing you all the best I do in your future endeavours! For now, let us relax. Our vacation begins now!"

"Salutations! I see you're concerned as to why my son isn't playing with the other kids. We've had a long day and he's currently adjusting to his first flight. He's alright, just resting. Anyways, we are the rarest of all the Yoshis, as we're a cross-breed of the Blue, Red & Yellow Yoshis! The only way to ride us is to go above & beyond the main epic quest. If you're up for it, try & collect all of the Dragon coins in all the levels. You can always check your progress at Peach's castle at any time. Once you collect all 81 stars in the main quest, head through a special door located behind Peach's throne for a special surprise!"

"Peach Talk B"
"It's difficult to explain what this gift truly is, & things such as its origins & name are still unknown. I feel it can be best described as this binding, intangible force infused into our DNA by our creator, essentially transforming us into leaders of sorts. You could say it's a sort of covenant or religion, where our creator acts through us. It's this gift that warrants us to be the most suitable rulers of the Mushroom Kingdom. Whoever wields this gift gains the ability to channel their motivations & intentions into reality in a way like no other! It's a gift that, at least until now, has been impenetrable to space, distance, emotions or time."

"That is, until recently. Bowser's forces, military, & technological advances must have been growing much faster than any of us could have predicted, & he believes that his top engineers have found a way to extract and replicate this sacred gift. He would then instill this gift somehow into HIS DNA, & be able to channel whatever horrid intentions he has onto this world. That cannot be allowed to happen, & it was prophesized right from the start that we must protect this gift just as much as we should one another."

"The monarchs that are my ancestors decided to form the Mushroom Kingdom Royal Force, a group of highly trained individuals that purely focus on defence & protection. This force has thankfully held our kingdom together well for generations to come. We were worried that with this discovery, the kingdom would fall into chaos. Thanks to you three, however, we are all safe & the kingdom is saved once more! I love each & every one of you so much for all that you sacrifice to protect me & I truly mean that! Honest! I wouldn't know what to do without you & am grateful for everything you've all done for me! *Kisses x3* Now, we have nothing to worry about for the time being. Let's enjoy our vacation as much as possible! I'm super excited!"

"End of an Epic"
"And so, our heroes' epic has come to an end. Mario, Luigi, Peach, Toad, Toadsworth, Challenger Toad & all of the Yoshis are about to take a well-deserved vacation. After all, our heroes had been through a lot in these past seven years, whether it be constantly traversing treacherous obstacles or being held captive against their will as usual. There's no telling how long they'll be gone, but let's hope that they'll all enjoy themselves!"

"Final Note"
"FINAL NOTE: I, Unknown68D, sincerely thank you from the bottom of my heart for playing The Epic Quest. This is a passion project that I have been working on ever since I was about 10 or 11 years old (18 at the time of typing this), all the way back when I first discovered SMBX. I won't get into many details here, but just know that this game has changed my life in many ways, enabling me to dip my toes in game development and computer systems. It's likely because of this game that I decided to pursue an avenue in computer-related fields. If you'd like to more about the development story, feel free to DM me on Discord @Unknown68D#0308!"
